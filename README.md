## Architecture

The Repository Docifier project follows a modular architecture, leveraging Next.js for routing and server-side rendering, React for building UI components, and Zustand for state management. Key architectural aspects include:

* **Frontend (React/Next.js):**  
  * Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and navigation.  
  * Uses React components for modularity and reusability.  
  * Next.js provides routing, server-side rendering, and API endpoints.  

* **State Management (Zustand):**  
  * Zustand is used for managing global application state, such as user authentication status, theme settings, and other shared data.  
  * Provides a simple and efficient way to manage state across components.  

* **UI Components (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS):**  
  * Radix UI provides a set of unstyled, accessible UI components.  
  * Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components and ensuring a consistent design.  

* **Code Editor (Monaco Editor):**  
  * The Monaco Editor is integrated for providing a rich code editing experience with features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and more.  

* **AI Assistance:**  
  * The AI-powered explanations feature interacts with an external AI service to provide explanations of code snippets. This likely involves API calls to a service like OpenAI or a custom-built AI model.
